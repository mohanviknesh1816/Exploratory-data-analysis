# Credit Card Customers – EDA Project

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a credit card customer dataset. The goal is to understand customer behavior, spending patterns, and financial activity using visualizations and statistics.

## 🔍 What I Did
I followed 5 steps to explore the data:

1. Summary Statistics  
   I calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for important numeric columns.

2. Visualizations  
   I used histograms and boxplots to understand the distribution and outliers of each feature.

3. Feature Relationships  
   I created a correlation matrix and pairplot to find how features relate to each other.

4. Trends and Anomalies  
   I used scatter plots and boxplots to find unusual values and patterns in spending and credit usage.

5. Final Inferences  
   I wrote down key insights based on the visuals and statistics.
## 📊 Key Features Analyzed
- Total_Trans_Amt (Total transaction amount)  
- Total_Trans_Ct (Total number of transactions)  
- Credit_Limit (Card limit assigned to the customer)  
- Avg_Utilization_Ratio (Ratio of used credit)
## 📌 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
## 📈 Key Insights
- Customers who make more transactions tend to spend more.
- Some customers are close to using 100% of their credit limit.
- A few customers have very high transaction amounts, which may be outliers or VIPs.
- Credit limit and usage behavior are useful to understand customer health.
